#  SCT_SD_Task3 – Sudoku Solver

This repository contains **Task 3** for my **Software Development Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**.

---

##  Task Objective

Create a program that takes an **unsolved Sudoku puzzle** as input and automatically solves it using a **backtracking algorithm**.  
The goal is to demonstrate problem-solving and algorithmic thinking in Python with a **user-friendly GUI**.

---

##  Key Features

- Provides a **Tkinter GUI** with a **9×9 grid** for user input.
- Accepts partial Sudoku puzzles — leave empty cells blank.
- Uses the **backtracking algorithm** to find a valid solution.
- Fills in the solved puzzle directly in the grid.
- Shows success or error messages for invalid puzzles.

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (built-in Python GUI library)

---

##  Requirements

 This program uses only the built-in **`tkinter`** module.  
No external installation needed if you have Python 3.

---
